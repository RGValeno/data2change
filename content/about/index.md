At night, I'm pursuing a Masters Degree in Data Science at Rowan University in the Greater Philadelphia area.

In my previous role, I was a software engineer for over 2 years learning the fundamentals of software development, to help me excel in writing clean and easily readable code necessary for scalability in Machine Learning and Data Science.
